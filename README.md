# My dotfiles on archlinux

Here are some details about my setup:

    WM : bspwm
    Shell : fish 
    Terminal : alacritty 
    Editor : neovim/neovide
    Panel : polybar
    Compositor : picom
    Notify Daemon : dunst
    Application Launcher : rofi
    File Manager : ranger
    Wallpaper Manager : feh

## Neovim

My ~~awesome~~(still need more efforts) neovim configurations, built from zero!

    Plugin Manager: lazy.nvim
    Lsp: nvim-lspconfig
    Formatter: conform.nvim

## install

edit dotfiles var in `install.sh`

run: `sh install.sh` ( if you trust me

it just back up if the dir is existing and create soft link

you need more efforts to configurations before using them completely
